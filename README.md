# ZwheUI Component Library

A showcase of a modern, reusable, and aesthetically pleasing React component library built with TypeScript. This project demonstrates a complete design system with a focus on dark-mode aesthetics, smooth animations, and a highly composable architecture.

## âœ¨ Features

*   **Comprehensive Component Set**: Over 80+ components, ranging from basic form elements to a complex, interactive node editor and data visualization charts.
*   **Built with React & TypeScript**: Type-safe and modern component architecture.
*   **Zero-Dependency Styling**: A custom CSS-in-JS solution (`useStyles` hook) provides scoped styles without external libraries.
*   **Dynamic Theming**: Easily switch between dark, light, and a fully customizable theme in real-time.
*   **Responsive & Accessible**: Components are designed to be responsive and include ARIA attributes for accessibility.
*   **Composable by Design**: Complex components like `Audio`, `Video`, and `Charts` are built from smaller, reusable parts.
*   **Animation Hooks**: Custom hooks for creating fluid animations and transitions (`useFade`, `useSlide`, `useCurveAnimation`).

## ðŸš€ Live Showcase

This application itself serves as a live interactive showcase. You can see all the components in action, test their functionality, and switch themes to see how they adapt.
